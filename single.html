          <p>
            I woke up at 5am today. Well, waking up is not exactly what I did, I didn't really sleep the night before and had about an hour-long period between being asleep and awake. I felt weird. I was a nervous wreck the night before, for a variety of reasons. What was it I'm feeling? A sense of urgency to get on the road. A reluctance to leave. A desire to move forward with my life as quickly as possible. Losing money every day that I'm not working. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been so cut off from anybody in this city right now it is ridiculous. I just finished my last freelance job and couldn't accept anything else because I was leaving. For the past week I've just been here alone with my thoughts counting down the days until I leave.
          </p>

          <p>I think my feelings were mostly a growing sense of excitement coupled with anxiety and nervousness. These kinds of trips are never easy, you can plan for it as much as you want and your plans always unravel somehow in the end. I really wanted to just go with the flow on this trip, but now it is becoming so structured and mired in detail. I don't want to worry about where I'm going to live when I get to Oakland. I want to just get there, then figure it out. I guess I could just couch surf for two weeks, but I'm too polite to impose on people. So I have to plan for a place to stay a month in advance. And now that I'm tied to that place, I'm tied to a set timeline for my trip. </p>

          <p>I drove to Jacob Riis Beach today in Rockaway. I was very scared to get on the freeway for a number of reasons. The first reason being that I haven't driven a car in over 4 years. And I bought an $1600 Subaru with a loose stickshift. I am also not the greatest with directions. And driving at night. So I figured I'd get all of that out of the way today before I get on to the road. I still wasn't going near Manhattan.</p>

          <p>I had my new camera in tow, and I wanted to catch the sunrise over the beach, so I was speeding along on the Brooklyn/Queens Expressway, chasing the sun all the way there. When I got there, I found the beach closed for repairs from Hurricane Sandy last year. Sooo, I snuck in the back way and parked my car on a cement patch right next to the sand, not a moment too soon. The sun was just creeping up over the horizon, so I burst out of the car and ran to the shoreline to get the footage. I yelled for joy when I saw the sun first peak over the horizon. I realized, this was possibly the first time in my life I have ever sat and watch the sun come up. And caught it on tape. </p>

          <p>I had to leave quicky, when I got back to the car, a park services rep was parked next to my car yelling loudly, "You can't park here, you gotta leave or I'll call the cops!" So I replied, "Oops sorry buddy, I didn't know", and took off. The entire beach was closed so there was no where else to park. But I got the footage I wanted so I left, about a half hour after I arrived there. </p>

          <p>I immediately drove back to Brooklyn, ate a large breakfast at a quaint little diner in Prospect Heights, then went back to my house to do an incredibly large load of laundry I left stinking up my room for two weeks. I had this nagging urge to get as much footage of New York as I could before I left. I wanted to get a particular shot of Brooklyn that I used to see every day on my ride to work, so I took the M train over the bridge and filmed the view of the city from Brooklyn to Manhattan. I went back and forth on the train about four times to make sure I didn't mess it up the first two times, with all the passengers probably grumbling, "Goddamn tourists". I wandered around the Lower East Side aimlessly for a few hours thinking I'd take a bunch of artsy shots of the city but ended up not taking any. Maybe I just wanted to be in the city one last time without a camera in front of my face. </p>

          <p><img src="assets/img/samples/sample-post-image.jpg" alt="Post Image"></p>

          <p>I passed by the Bowery Ballroom, one of my favorite music venues in Manhattan and felt depressed all of a sudden. I was thinking to myself, "Why didn't I come here more often? Why didn't I take advantage of what this city had to offer me?" Its a shame, when you live in a city, you end up getting stuck in a pattern where you take the same route every day, home to work, work to home and never take a look around you to see what other routes there are to take. For me, I was working long hours and was so entrenched in my work, I never really stopped to just allow myself to be more a part of the city. I did this for 2.5 years and never changed. I see now what a mistake that was.</p>

          <p>It is now 2:30 a.m as I'm writing this and I'm realizing it's going to be another sleepless night.</p>
